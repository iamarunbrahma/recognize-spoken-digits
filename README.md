# Spoken Digit Recognition

Here, we are recognizing digits from 0 to 9 based on spoken audio. Input data will be in the form of speech signal and output will be a single digit.

We are using raw audio and training it using LSTM architecture. We are also converting speech signal into spectrogram and training it using LSTM architecture.
